# Webserver_with_GUI
An easy to use Webserver with GUI

This is a web server, written in java,
which is easy to use with an simple GUI.
The webserver whithout GUI is by SSaurel,
from his tutorial, but I have modifyed 
this code mouch.

The Java version, which is compiled,
is the version 14, but you can compile
the sourcecode yourself.

# Sourcecompiling and running
The sourches for the code can be found into the "sourches.zip", 
it have to be extracted into your eclipse workspace and needs 
to be opened as project with eclipse, to comile it go to export as runnable jar file.

Open it like so:
New > Java Project

Note:
The project name have to be the same as the name of the folder!
If this is not so, it wouldn't work!
